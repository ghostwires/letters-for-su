            <p>This game was written in the span of... three or four days(?) for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/smoochie-jam-24" target="_blank">Neo-Interactives Smoochie Jam!</a></p>

            <p>It is also unabashed fanned fiction derived from the game duology <a href="https://www.ace-attorney.com/great1-2/us/" target="_blank">The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</a>. If you want to know more about what Susato's up to in England, or if you like any combination of steampunk, Sherlock Holmes, lawyer simulators, and visual novels with sick music, I cannot recommend it strongly enough.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, the font for the title screen is from the <a href="https://creativemarket.com/ARN/869076-Sakura-Font-Set" target="_blank">Sakura Font Set</a>!</p>

            <p>This is my first ever entry to a game jam, and I hope you enjoy :)</p>
