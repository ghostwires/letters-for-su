            <p>Dear Susato,</p>

            <p>It's spring here in Japan, and the cherry blossoms are all in bloom. I hope you are in good health! <button class="edit-button" id="edit-button-1">[]</button></p>

                <p>No, that's too formal. Su would never laugh at you, but her eyes would crease in that way you've memorized so well over an entire decade...</p>

            <p>Dear Su,</p>

            <p>Can you believe it's spring already? The cherry blossoms are everywhere this time of year! I walked by where you live the other day, when I was coming home from the lab, and the tree in your backyard actually managed a single flower this year.</p>

                <button class="change-button" id="change-button-2-1">Just like me.</button>
                <button class="change-button" id="change-button-2-2">Just like you.</button>
                <button class="change-button" id="change-button-2-3">Don't say any of that, are you mad?</button>
            </div>

            <div class="letter-text" id="letter-text-2-1" hidden>
                <p>I feel the same way sometimes. Mother's wonderful, obviously, but it's quiet without you around here. Professor Mikotoba always looks a bit down.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="letter-text" id="letter-text-2-2" hidden>
                <p>Oh, if only I had a camera, it looked just like the pattern on your kimono -- do they let you wear that in Great Britain's courtrooms? I hope they do. I know it's always been your dream to work there with Asougi-san! Even if Englanders aren't really known for their hospitality...</p>

            <div class="letter-text" id="letter-text-2-3" hidden>
                <p>Which didn't make me think of anything, because it was a typical cherry blossom, and cherry blossoms famously don't symbolize anything like death or transience or acceptance of fate or <button class="edit-button" id="edit-button-2-3">[]</button></p>

                <p>You should tell me how the trials are going over there! I'm no judicial assistant, but they must be so exciting! I bet you've swept everyone off your feet already, haven't you?</p>

                <p>Is that why you haven't written yet? <button class="edit-button" id="edit-button-3">[]</button></p>

            <div class="letter-text" id="letter-text-4" hidden>
                <p>I miss you. We all do. Professor Mikotoba invited me to lunch with your grandmother, did you know? I didn't even realize she knew what my name was.</p>

                <p>She's really proud of you. Don't tell her I told you that.</p>

                <p>Professor Mikotoba says you're doing wonderfully, and he has the utmost faith in you, and you've been in contact with him a few times, but you're too busy these days to write letters. I guess I just have too much free time on my hands... The lab work has been slow ever since Dr. Wilson 'retired,' but I heard the military might be commissioning us for something new next month. It'll be a nice distraction, at least.<span id="letter-text-4-1"> I think about you far too often these days.</span> <button class="edit-button" id="edit-button-4-1">[]</button></p>

            <div class="letter-text" id="letter-text-5" hidden>
                <p>Anyway, I know you're busy and I won't make this letter too long, but write back when you have the chance, okay? Don't go forgetting me!</p>
